De novo characterization of a black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) transcriptome and gene expression analysis upon exposure to withering syndrome.

Withering syndrome (WS), a fatal disease of abalone, is caused by infection of esophageal and digestive gland epithelial cells with a rickettsial bacterium (RLO). Black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) populations in southern and central California have experienced losses of up to 99% due to WS epidemics and are currently listed as endangered. Here we compare transcriptomes of RLO exposed and unexposed black abalone to better understand genes associated with disease expression. Studying differentially expressed genes related to disease exposure may help elucidate important molecular processes responsible for WS disease resistance. This information could have profound implications for the conservation and restoration of this critically endangered species.

The results of this study are important and valuable for the management of Californiaâ€™s wild abalone populations, successful abalone aquaculture and for restoration of at risk and endangered species. Successful restoration of black and other affected abalone species as well as successful expansion of the aquaculture industry may be predicated on a thorough understanding of the abalone-RLO relationship.
